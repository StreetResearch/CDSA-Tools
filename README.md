# CDSA-Tools
Tools to make living CDSA easier and faster. This is a work in progress!
You will need the following installed on your system to utilize these codes:
<ol>
  <li>Python 3.10</li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
</ol>
So far, we have:
<ol>
  <li>General chemistry tools:
    <ol>
      <li>Molecular Weight Calculator</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
<br>
  <li>Self-assembly tools:
    <ol>
      <li>living CDSA calculator (for seeded growth experiments)</li>
      <li>Micelle Counting Statistics and Histogram Script (auotmates the analysis of measured nanoparticle sizes/lengths from Fiji/ImageJ).
          <br>To use this script, just place it in the folder with your measurment data from Fiji and ensure the measurments file is called "Results.csv".<br>
          Then run the batch script!</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
More ideas coming when I have time! Any feedback is welcome =)

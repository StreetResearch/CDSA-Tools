# CDSA-Tools
Tools to make living CDSA easier and faster. This is a work in progress!

You will need Python 3.10 and Numpy / SciPy / Matplotlib to utilize these codes!

So far, we have:

General chemistry tools:
1) Molecular Weight Calculator

Self-assembly tools:
2) living CDSA calculator (for seeded growth experiments)
3) micelle counting algorithm (assists measuring nanoparticles with Fiji/ImageJ)

More ideas coming when I have time! Any feedback is welcome =)
